Reference documentation resource links below for more details.    

**Google Apps Script**  -  [[Link to Documentation]][1]
Platform on which this serverless web app is built.

**PDF Layer**  -  [[Link to Documentation]][2]
High quality and highly customizable HTML to PDF conversion API.  It can be quite cumbersome to style PDF.
*TIP*:  Incline-css works best for styling final PDF document. Thank me later.

**Zoho CRM API**  -  [[Link to Documentation]][3]
[Zoho][8] is an online customer relationship manager platform.  If Salesforce and Google had a baby, it's prodigy would be [Zoho][8].  The webpage in this web app is pre-populated with data from our [Zoho][8] CRM via it's RESTful API.

**Axios**  -  [[Link to Usefull Article]][4]
A promise-based HTTP client that works both in the browser and in a node.js environment. It basically provides a single API for dealing with ```XMLHttpRequests``` and node’s ```http``` interface. Besides that, it wraps the requests using a polyfill for ES6 new’s promise syntax.
